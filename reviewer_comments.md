What a wonderful figure. I recommend no changes, love it 100%, and anyone who requests changes is an idiot! I look forward to seeing you collect your Nobel Peach Prize.

## Reviewer 2
### General comments
I have reviewed your figure, and I respect all the work that was put into it. Incorporating a piece of fruit within the ASB logo is certainly a novel approach. That said, I have some major concerns regarding the values that your peach conveys. Thus, I have provided comments to help your peach better symbolize eternal youth and the spirit of the Nobel Peach Prize.
